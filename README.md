## Notes for porting this to battlecode21

When Battlecode 2021 comes around, it will probably useful to reuse a fair amount of this codebase. Mainting git history is nice, but not trivial. The following steps were taken to port `battlecode19` to this repo and maintain history (assuming we start in this repo):

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode19
cd battlecode19
git checkout -b battlecode20export
git filter-branch --prune-empty --index-filter 'var=$(git ls-files | grep -v "^api\|^app") && test "$var" && git rm $var --cached'
cd ..
cd battlecode20
git pull ../battlecode19 --allow-unrelated-histories
mv api backend
mv app frontend
```

This procedure keeps the history nicely.
